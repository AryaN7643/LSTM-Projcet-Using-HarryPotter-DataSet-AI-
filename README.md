# LSTM-Projcet-Using-HarryPotter-DataSet-AI-
This project implements a character-level LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network trained on dialogue from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to generate new text in the style of the book's characters. The model learns patterns in the dialogue sequences and can generate coherent text continuations based on learned context.
